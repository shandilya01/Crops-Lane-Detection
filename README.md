# Crops-Lane-Detection

The repository contains 2 python models for lanes identification/Steering Direction prediction on a Crop Field such that the Crops are not crushed for an Automated-BOT on the field.

 **FS_pathfinding.py:** *tries to predict the direction in which the BOT front tyres should move with a BLUE line.*
 
 **FS_pathFinding2.py:** *tries to predict the overall direction of the BOT.*
